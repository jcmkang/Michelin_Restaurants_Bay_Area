## About
This GUI application allows a user to choose multiple Michelin Guide restauarant from cities surrounding San Francisco, Cupertino, and San Jose. The user will be able to make a selection based on the City or Cuisine. When the user chooses a city or cuisine, a list of restaurants in that city or cuisine will display. When restauarnts are chosen, the application will display to the user with the restrautn's name, address, cost, and cuisine and a button to open a tab on their probser with the Micheile Guide page of the chosen restaurant. <br><br>
The project has two parts: frontend.py and backend.py
- The backend.py will get data by webscraping from the Micheline Guide page. From the extracted data, a JSON file is created to store the data. The data from JSON file is then read into a SQLite Database to be used by frontend.py
- frontend.py interacts with the user while fetching data from SQLite Databse

## Running the Application
- First, run backend.py to get the data, create a JSON file, and write the JSON to a SQLite Database
- After backend.py has created 3 JSON files and 3 DB files for San Jose, Cupertino, and San Francisco, Run frontend.py to start the GUI application
