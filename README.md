# Michelin Guide Restaurants Bay Area

## About
This GUI application allows a user to choose multiple Michelin Guide restauarants from cities surrounding San Francisco, Cupertino, and San Jose. The user will be able to make a selection based on the City or Cuisine. When the user chooses a city or cuisine, a list of restaurants in that city or cuisine will display. When restauarnts are chosen, the application will display to the user with the restrautn's name, address, cost, and cuisine and a button to open a tab on their probser with the Micheile Guide page of the chosen restaurant. <br><br>

The project has two parts: frontend.py and backend.py
- <u>Backend.py</u> creates a database by webscraping data from 3 Bay Area cities from the Micheline Guide.
- <u>Frontend.py</u> interacts with the user while fetching data from SQLite Databse

## Running the Application
- First, run backend.py to scrape the data, create a JSON file, and combine the JSON to a SQLite Database
- After backend.py has created the combined DB file for San Jose, Cupertino, and San Francisco..
- Run frontend.py to start the GUI application
